#Welcome to the mbed handbook

Welcome to the mbed handbook; we're here to help you get started with an mbed project. 

##About mbed

mbed gives you everything you need to be able to work with a wide selection of ARM-based boards: an on-line development environment, an SDK and an HDK.

##About the handbook

The handbook contains four sections; you can read them in sequence, but they can also be read as stand-alone. They are:

1. **Getting Started**: introduction to the platforms and components, registration, and a first program using the mbed compiler.

2. **Development Fundamentals**: overview of the API, SDK and HDK, with links to more detailed technical documents. 

3. **Advanced Development**: how to write, debug, publish and document your own code, as well as using external toolchains.

4. **The mbed Community**: where to get help, how to contribute to the community, and educational resources.
