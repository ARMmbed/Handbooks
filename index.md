#Welcome to the mbed v2 handbook

Welcome to the mbed v2 handbook; we're here to help you get started with an mbed project. 

##About mbed

mbed gives you everything you need to be able to work with a wide selection of ARM-based boards: an on-line development environment, an SDK and an HDK.

##About the handbook

<div id="note">
<b>Note</b>: this handbook is for v2. We'll be releasing a new handbook for v3 shortly.
</div>

This handbook has been migrated from [developer.mbed.org](developer.mbed.org) with only mild changes (mostly rearrangement). It covers:

1. [An introduction](Getting_Started/Intro/) to mbed, the API, SDK and HDK, platforms and components.

2. [A getting started guide](/Getting_Started/User_Plat_Reg/) for first-time users including how to use the compiler and create a first program. 

3. [A review of development on mbed](/Dev_Fun/Intro/) covering basics such as the API and debugging.

4. [A more in depth look](/Adv_Dev/Coding_Style/) at development.

5. [A review of the CMSIS-DAP](/Dev_Fun/CMSIS/) debug interface on mbed. 

6. [And introduction to the mbed community](/Community/Intro/) and how you can contribute to it.
