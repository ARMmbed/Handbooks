##How can I get additional mbed accounts

You can signup without access to an mbed platform. Then you can add platforms to your mbed Compiler by finding the appropriate platform on the [platforms page](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms) and clicking "Add to mbed Compiler", this will allow you to compile for that platform.

**How to ask for help with code**
<br />
A good way to get help with a piece of code that's not working for you is to *Publish* the program. To do this, right click the program in the Compiler and choose Publish. Include the URL returned in your post.
<br />
This way users can very easily check over your complete program and therefore help you better.

##Introduction

The [Questions](http://developer.mbed.org/questions/) section of mbed is designed to provide a high quality resource of common (and not so common) questions and answers. This means that instead of searching long forum threads for the answer to a query or problem, both the question and answer will hopefully be captured succinctly on a single page.

##How to use the feature

###What is a good question?

A good question is:

* Answerable - ie, not a topic of debate.

* Specific - try and accurately describe the problem.

* Reproducible - If your question is about a specific bit of code, publish the program in question and include it in your question.

Open-ended questions which can have several different 'correct' answers are better suited to the forum.

###What is a good answer?

Read the question carefully and make sure your answer tries to provide a solution â€“ or a viable alternative. Use the formatting available to make to answer more clear, and provide links and source code where possible. If you need the original author to clarify or provide more details, please ask them to do so in the **comments** section of their question.

###When and why should I accept an answer?

If a user of mbed has posted a suitable answer that has solved your problem, then you should mark the question as **Accepted**. This means that the user knows you value their answer and lets future readers know which is the best answer.

###When should I use comments?

If you do not have a solution to the question, however you have something useful to add then you should **Post a comment** under the related question or answer.

##FAQ


###What can I do to help?

* Ask questions!

* Post answers!

We want to encourage all our users to ask questions in the Questions area. If you have a question that you think could have a specific answer, then this is the place. If you want to discuss a particular topic, then the forum would be better place for that.


###Where can I leave feedback or suggestions?
