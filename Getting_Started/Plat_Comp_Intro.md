##Overview

mbed provides a way of prototyping hardware-based projects and products by giving you the hardware (ARM-processors on a board, and external components) and the ability to write software to control it (using the mbed API and IDE). 

##Platforms and Components

All mbed programs are written for one or more [platforms](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/): a board with an ARM microcontroller and various capabilities such as receiving and processing input, generating output and storing small bits of information. 

You need to select a platform that matches what you're trying to achieve, as they all have different capabilities. But platforms don't have to be used on their own - you can add external [components](http://developer.mbed.org/components/) to enhance functionality.

##Platform Programming

Platform programming is done in C++; it relies on APIs that abstract the hardware, protocols and component support.

<b>Tip:</b> for more information about the software development kit, see our [SDK section](/Dev_Fun/SDK/).

All platforms run a `.hex` file generated by either our [online compiler](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/) or an offline tool of your choosing. 

##Platform Interoperability 

To help you experiment and prototype, we've moved the interoperability of platforms behind the scenes. You write one program, and the IDE can then compile it to fit as many different platforms as you require, without any manual recoding.
