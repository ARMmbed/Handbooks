#Getting Started

This section will lead you through the process of creating your first mbed program. We'll start with introducing our boards and components, then show you how to register and work with our compiler and API. 

The program you'll create in this section is called Blinky. If you've already set up your IDE and have a board, you can skip ahead to the Blinky example.
