#Blinky

The first program we'll use is a test program - it's meant to show you that your board is functional and that you're compiling to the right platform. It's called [Blinky](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed/code/mbed_blinky/). 

#What you need

To get this program going, all you need is: 

+ A BLE-enabled mbed board.

+ A user on [developer.mbed.org](developer.mbed.org) to access the compiler.

#Quick guide

If youâ€™re familiar with mbed and our compiler, you can get Blinky working in just a few minutes:

1. Open the compiler and select or add your board.

2. Import [``Blinky``](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed/code/mbed_blinky/) to your compiler.

3. Compile the code. It will be downloaded to your Downloads folder (on some browsers you may need to specify a download location).

4. Drag and drop the compiled file to your board.

5. Restart the board.

6. The LED will flash.
