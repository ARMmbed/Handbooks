#Getting Started

This section will lead you through the process of creating your first mbed program:

1. [Platform and component introduction](/1_Getting_Started/2_Plat_Comp_Intro/). 

2. [User and platform registration](/1_Getting_Started/3_User_Plat_Reg/). 

3. [Working with the mbed compiler, and a few words about APIs](/1_Getting_Started/4_IDE_API/).

4. [Your first program](/1_Getting_Started/5_First_Pro/).

The program you'll create in this section is called Blinky. If you've already set up your IDE and have a board, you can skip ahead to the [Blinky example](/1_Getting_Started/5_First_Pro/).
