#Getting Started

This section will lead you through the process of creating your first mbed program:

1. Platform and component introduction. 

2. User and platform registration. 

3. Working with the mbed compiler, and a few words about APIs.

4. Your first program. 

The program you'll create in this section is called Blinky. If you've already set up your IDE and have a board, you can skip ahead to the Blinky example.
