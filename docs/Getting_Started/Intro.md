#Working with mbed

This section will lead you through the process of creating a prototype on an mbed board:

<div id="imagec">
<img src="/Getting_Started/Images/fullmbedprocess.png">
</div>
<div id="caption">
The standard process is to get a board (and maybe a few extending components), write a bit of code and import it to the board. Simple.
</div>

We'll look at the extended process, which includes creating a user and registering a platform. We'll also review our online compiler and show you how to build your first program:

2. [User and platform registration](/Getting_Started/User_Plat_Reg/). 

1. [Boards and components](/Introduction/Plat_Comp_Intro/). 

3. [Working with the mbed compiler](/Getting_Started/Using_IDE/) and [some shortcuts](/Getting_Started/IDE_Shortcuts/).

4. [Your first program](/Getting_Started/First_Pro/).

5. Where to [get help](/Getting_Started/Questions/).

The program you'll create in this section is called `Blinky`. If you've already set up your IDE and have a board, you can skip ahead to the [Blinky example](/Getting_Started/First_Pro/).
