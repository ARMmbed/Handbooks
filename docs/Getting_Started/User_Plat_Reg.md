#Creating a User

If you want to use the [online IDE](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/) or participate in the [mbed community](https://developer.mbed.org/forum/), you'll need a user on [developer.mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org/account/signup/).

#Platform Registration
</a>

Once you have an account you can register platforms - they will be associated with your account and you'll be able to select them as a target in the compiler. 

The easiest way to register a platform is using the HTML file that is pre-installed on it:

1. Log in to mbed [site](https://developer.mbed.org) with your mbed account.

2. Plug your board into your computer's USB port. The board will be displayed in your file browser as a removable storage (similar to plugging in your phone or a USB stick).

3. In your file browser, double-click the board to see its files. By default, every board has an HTML file. 

4. Double click the board's .HTML file to navigate to its page on the mbed site. 

5. On the board's page, click *Add to your mbed Compiler*.
