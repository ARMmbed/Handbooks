#Worldwide Developer Community

Using mbed means a huge shared context with other developers, and that means when you have a question, there is less pre-amble, less explanation and less time reproducing issues, and more time getting answers. We're proud that this has helped us grow an active and friendly community of skilled developers that are collectively helping get prototypes made even faster.

But where it really gets interesting is with code. Our developers are sharing thousands of open source repositories and building an extensive cookbook of recipes that you can reuse to build your products.

We've also made contributing back is easy; you can publish a library to mbed.org with a few clicks in the IDE, and let others build on your hard work. In fact, this is how some of our users end up collaborating on hard problems, and even getting contract work.

You can join the [discussions on the forum](http://developer.mbed.org/forum/) or ask [questions](http://developer.mbed.org/questions/). And don't forget to [read the blog](http://developer.mbed.org/blog/).

For information about asking questions and dealing with problems, see [the Getting Help section](/Getting_Started/Questions/).
